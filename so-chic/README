I. DATA SOURCES

APB (MEOP) dataset are stored in netcdf with exact convention of Argo netcdf files.
PFL (Argo+soccom+WOD) dataset combines Soccom and Argo floats.

WOD stored more APB profiles than MEOP from other data sources,while various people (Pierre D. and my wife) suggested that 
MEOP seal-tag is most reliable source compared to others. Therefore, I conservatively used only MEOP seal-tag data here.

CTD (BODC+PANGAEA+CCHDO+WOD) are merged from various database with the majority comes from WOD18 dataset. Duplicated profiles
are removed with the preference to those from WOD.

Data are bundled by year for APB and PFL, by decades for ship-based CTD.

II. QC FLAGS

QC flags scale of floats and APB follows Argo flags (Reference Table 2, Argo QC manual_v2.8)

0	No QC was performed.
1	Good data. the adjusted value is statistically consistent and a statistical error estimate is supplied.
2	Probably good data. 
3	Probably bad data. An adjustment has been applied, but the value may still be bad.
4	Bad data. Bad data, not adjustable, data replaced by FillValue.
5	Value changed.
6	Not used.
7	Not used.
8	Interpolated value. (Useful for identifying profiles under ice, but missed in WOD profiles)
9	Missing value.

QC flags scale of CTD follows WOD18 code table (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/CODES/Definition_of_Quality_Flags.html)
(b) Observation level
0	accepted value
1	range outlier ( outside of broad range check )
2	failed inversion check
3	failed gradient check
4	observed level bullseye flag and zero gradient check
5	combined gradient and inversion checks
6	failed range and inversion checks
7	failed range and gradient checks
8	failed range and questionable data checks
9	failed range and combined gradient and inversion checks
(c) Standard level
0	accepted value
1	bullseye marker
2	density inversion
3	failed annual standard deviation check
4	failed seasonal standard deviation check
5	failed monthly standard deviation check
6	failed annual and seasonal standard deviation check
7	failed annual and monthly standard deviation check
8	failed seasonal and monthly standard deviation check
9	failed annual, seasonal and monthly standard deviation check

III. Ad hoc selections 

For all the profiles, only flagged-good records are selected.
PFL/APB: flag_qc = [1,2,5,8];
CTD: flag_qc = 0; Some scattered cruise CTD profiles from Pangaea and CCHDO does not have quality flags. And those are treated 
as 'good' profiles.

Individual cruise CTD profiles excluded from WOD database are interpolated onto WOD standard level in standard level CTD data 
when merging, while remained the same in observation level CTD data.

PFL and APB data are sorted in (N_LEVEL*N_PROF) matrix with a constant N_LEVEL for each single netcdf file. However, the vertical
coordinate per profile is actually inconsistent. A Constant N_LEVEL is applied for easier bundling of the data. Values of missing 
profile variables (PRES,TEMP,PSAL) are filled by NaN as in the provided argo sample file.

In total, 15976 CTD profiles (12880 from WOD18, 3096 from other database), 44899 float profiles (41018 from Argo+SOCCOM, 3881 from WOD18),
101270 APB profiles from MEOP are archived.

IV. Other

.csv file is friendly to matlab using readmatrix function with suitable 'opts' (defining delimiters, data type etc.). 'opts' can be determined from
the generated script using ImportData GUI.

A new profile_readfunction for WOD18 style .csv file is created based on old '/MITprof_IO/profile_read_wod05.m', '/MITprof_IO/profile_read_wod18.m'. 
Changes are applied on read-in format of the header section that matches WOD18 spreadsheet file.
